SpacifyPlus
=================================

Pieces of code just because

spacify-factor down a function to transform 'the input string' to 't h e i n p u t s t r i n g'
The plus in this spacify means that unlike the usual spacify, this spacify outputs a single space in between each non spaced character regardless of how many spaces already exist in the string. There are also no spaces left on either end of the output.
